Hello, my name is Maanya Naveen. Currently, I am a third year majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics at the University of Cincinnati. I have a keen interest in Software Development and I have an interest in creating visually appealing designs through code. In my free time, I usually take a nap. As of now, I have a huge interest in Urban Exploration even though it can be a bit spooky at times.
